                    The goal: instant recall of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division facts
What is 5+ 3? Did the number 8 pop into your head? It should. How about 6 X 7? Instant recall of math facts is when we simply know the answer without having to count in our heads, count fingers or pursue other strategies to reach the answer.

Why are math facts so important?
Recalling the basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division facts quickly is critical because it allows a student to study more advanced math topics without being bogged down by simple calculations. 

Recall of math facts correlates with success in math at school. Students who donâ€™t have immediate recall of math facts spend much of their time on basic computations instead of learning higher order math skills. Sadly, the average Grade 5 student only knows 32% of his multiplication tables. Both the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) and the National Mathematics Advisory Panel urge that all students develop automatic recall of math facts.

When to study math facts
Students should begin to focus on developing instant recall of math facts only after they have a firm understanding of the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Typically, students should strive to have instant recall of their addition and subtraction facts by the end of grade 2 and their multiplication and division facts by the end of grade 3; however, this can vary for each child.  Fluency in math facts will help children gain confidence in math and excel in other areas of math.

Tools for learning math facts
The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) states that students who cannot retrieve basic math facts easily get lost and often cannot follow local of an explanation when the problems are embedded within more complex mathematic operations, such as simple algebra or long division.
K5's own online math program focuses on building an understanding of math concepts, including those of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  This is a great foundation for studying math facts.  To achieve instant recall in math facts, we encourage students to practice with other tools as well, including:

traditional math facts flashcards
math facts worksheets 
software programs and apps. 
There are countless apps, games and websites offering math facts practice; however, most of them provide simple random fact  practice.  The best programs analyze chlidrens' responses (both accuracy and speed), evaluate which facts they need additional practice on and adopt their quizzing accordingly, thus making the process quite a bit more efficient.  We recommend XtraMath as a very good and free tool.

5 minutes a day to mastery
Developing instant recall in math facts does take time.  Try to practice one addition lesson (5-10 minutes) per day or every second day.  Keeps this up until the student has instant recall of all the math facts up to 10 plus 10.  Then subtraction, multiplication and finally division.  

What is K5?
K5 Learning offers reading and math worksheets, workbooks and an online reading and math program for kids in kindergarten to grade 5.

In our online program, kids work at their own level and their own pace through a personalized curriculum of reading and math lessons; each lesson is accompanied by customized printable worksheets for further study.

 K5 helps your children build good study habits and excel in school.
